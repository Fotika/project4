Create the Quiz Score Application. The application prompts the user for the name of a text file that contains the quiz scores of a student. It reads the text file and computes the final quiz score, which is the average of all scores after dropping the lowest one. It then creates a new text file named “output.txt” and stores the calculated final quiz score. The program output should be formatted as shown in the Sample Run.
